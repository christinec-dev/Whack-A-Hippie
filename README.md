# Whack-A-Hippie

The other day, I watched Season two of The Umbrella Academy, and it got me thinking about the sixties. Now, I was not born yet in the 1960s - and neither were my parents - but you know what was born in the 1960s? HIPPIES! HIPPIES! HIPPIES!

By this time, a whack-a-mole game was on my list of React projects to attempt on my own, so I tried to take the path of love and peace and turn it into Whack-A-Hippie instead. Okay okay, so you won't actually whack a hippie, but you will be able to turn off the tv when one pops up - same principle. When you whack a hippie, the score automatically updates during 30s of gameplay, and your highest score will even be saved in your Local Browser Storage. Did I mention the remote cursor?

This was my first attempt at using Redux, which was pretty once I read through the documentation on their website https://redux.js.org. My Redux store  binds together all my reducer state functions to compile my app functionality, and my Reducer file contains all functions that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result. In other words, (state, action) => newState. Then, I created my usual components file which will render the Game, Hippie and Status components to the App.js. I also learnt to use Immutable and Lodash (explained in my source code).

Day one 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 (it took so long because of assignments, oof) of trying to code in React on my own was a success. I completed it with the following: React, Reduct, Lodash, Immutable, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and SCSS.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
